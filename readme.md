## Pythagorean theorem

An experiment in "pairing" with Gemini Pro to make a thing. Conversation (to date):

Goal is to interactively demonstrate Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

The visualization is intended to be something like https://www.geogebra.org/m/apubVUSe (but
interactive instead of linear) and like http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI47.html
it should contain the translated text of the proof and hyperlink the original propositions so you
get a sense of the conversation Euclid was embedded in.

That said, this is also intended to see how far I can take a "see what

So far the most intersesting part is that Gemini got several things surprisingly right starting with
creating a recognizable version of the proof diagram in d3.js/SVG in one shot after being prompted
with a GIF (though of course this is a famous diagram it's surely seen in its training data.)
